Feature

- Click any text cell (including this one) to edit it
- The code in each code editor is all joined together into one file. If you define a variable in cell #1, you can refer to it in any following cells
- You can show any React components, string, number, or anything else by calling the `show` function. This is a function built into the environment. Call show multiple times to show multiple values
- Re-order or delete cells using the buttons on the top right
- Add new cells by hovering on the divider between each cell

Installation
All of your changes get saved to the file you opened Code-Station with. You can run `npx code-station serve test.js`, all of the text and code you write will be saved to the `test.js` file automatically.

npx code-station serve "file name" -p "port number"

Iteration Opportunities

1. More user-friendly output
2. Frontend improvement (fixed code editor height)
3. React syntax color highlighter
